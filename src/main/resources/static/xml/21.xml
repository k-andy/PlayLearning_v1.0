        <text>Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a “hello, world” program that simply prints
            out that statement. You need only a single method in your class (the “main” one that gets executed when
            the program starts). Remember to make it static and to include the argument list, even though you don’t
            use the argument list. Compile the program with javac and run it using java. If you are using a different
            development environment than the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.
